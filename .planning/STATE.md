# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-19)

**Core value:** Users see a complete draft meal plan in under 2 seconds (via streaming), then stay in control of exactly which meals get enriched with full recipes.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Spike: Use `grok-4-1-fast-non-reasoning` — reasoning models are 4x slower (39s vs ~10s)
- Spike: tRPC `endpoint` must be `"/trpc"` not `"/functions/v1/trpc"` — runtime strips prefix
- Spike: Streaming is required architecture for < 2s UX; batch floor is ~10s
- Spike: Spoonacular cache by `spoonacular_recipe_id` (not title) — IDs are stable

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 4 (streaming) is the critical path: token streaming from Grok through Edge Function to React client is not yet implemented. Batch approach (~10s) is the fallback but violates UX target.
